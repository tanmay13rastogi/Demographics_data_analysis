Project Overview: Demographics Data Analysis
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze demographic data to gain insights into various factors such as satisfaction scores, salary distributions, ethnicity distribution, and other relevant demographics. This analysis aims to provide a clear understanding of the demographic patterns and trends that can inform decision-making and strategic planning.

Key Components:
Data Loading and Initial Inspection:

Imported necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Loaded the demographic data from an Excel file.
Data Cleaning:

Identified and handled missing values by dropping rows with null entries.
Removed irrelevant rows and characters to standardize the data (e.g., removing '$' signs from salary columns).
Data Analysis and Visualization:

City-wise Satisfaction Scores:
Visualized average satisfaction scores by city using bar plots.
Ethnicity Distribution:
Created a pie chart to show the distribution of ethnicities in the dataset.
Salary Analysis:
Analyzed and visualized the average maximum salary by gender.
Examined the average maximum salary by job title and employment status.
Age Analysis:
Calculated and visualized the average age by job title.
